# Fox-Chicken-and-Grain
This is an implementation of the simple game of "Fox, Chicken and Grain" using linked lists and dynamic memory in an object oriented environment.

Instructions:

A particularly stupid farmer must get his fox, chicken and grain safely across a river, from the south
river bank to the north bank. The farmer makes trips across the river in a little boat, but can only
take at most one item with him on each trip. If he leaves the fox and the chicken alone together,
the fox will eat the chicken! If he leaves the chicken alone with the grain, the chicken will eat the
grain. The player must help the farmer by deciding what he should take with him (or nothing) on
each trip. Once all three items are on the north bank, the game is won. If anything gets eaten, the
game is lost.
